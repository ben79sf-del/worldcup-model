"""
results_tracker.py — Track Model Accuracy vs Real Outcomes
============================================================
Workflow:
  1. Each daily run snapshots predictions for upcoming fixtures
     (already done — predictions/history/YYYY-MM-DD.json)
  2. This script checks football-data.org for newly FINISHED matches
  3. Matches finished games against the prediction that was made for them
  4. Scores: 1X2 accuracy, Brier score, value-bet hit rate, ROI
  5. Appends results to a running ledger (predictions/results_log.json)
  6. Pushes ledger + summary stats to GitHub for the dashboard

Run this daily, ideally a few hours after matches finish (e.g. evening).
